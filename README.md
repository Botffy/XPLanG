The PLanG programming language is an educational programming language used at the Faculty of Information Technology of the Péter Pázmány Catholic University, Hungary, for teaching the very basics of programming in the first semester. The language and the small IDE/interpreter accompanying it was designed and implemented by László Lövei in the summer of 2005, based on a pseudocode language used earlier to describe algorithms on paper. A Pascal-like language, its main distinguishing feature is that its keywords are in Hungarian.

It's a small language: while it's Turing-complete (of course), it lacks subroutines, records, user-defined types, and it doesn't even have elsif.

I hated that language with a passion.

But I'm kinda weird, you know, and while everybody else just wanted to forget the language, I wanted to do something about it. Having taken a course in compilers at ELTE, I chose extending PLanG as the topic for my [self-directed laboratory project](https://github.com/Botffy/onlab), then I chose to continue the project for my thesis. This is that project. It's taking a while to do it, but oh well, what the hell.

The dream lives on.
